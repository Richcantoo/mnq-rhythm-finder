## 📊 How to Use

### Step 1: Build Your Database (First Time Setup)

Upload **100-500 historical MNQ charts**:

1. Go to "Upload Your MNQ Charts"
2. Select multiple chart screenshots (5-minute timeframe)
3. Click "Start AI Analysis"
4. System extracts:
   - Price patterns
   - Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, ATR)
   - Market regimes
   - Support/resistance levels

**Pro Tip:** More charts = better predictions. Aim for 500+ over time.

### Step 2: Get Predictions

1. Navigate to "AI Predictions & Analytics" tab
2. Upload your **current** MNQ chart
3. Click "Generate Enhanced Prediction"
4. Review the prediction:
   - **Direction**: Bullish/Bearish/Neutral
   - **Confidence**: 0-100%
   - **Recommendation**: BUY/SELL/**WAIT**
   - **4 Method Votes**: See how each method voted

### Step 3: Check Quality Metrics

Before acting on prediction, verify:
- ✅ **Confidence ≥70%** (high probability)
- ✅ **≥10 Similar Patterns** (statistically significant)
- ✅ **3+ Methods Agree** (consensus)
- ✅ **Quality Badge: HIGH** (meets all criteria)

**If quality is LOW or recommendation is WAIT:** Don't trade! System is filtering out uncertain setups.

### Step 4: Review Technical Details

Click "Technical" tab to see:
- **RSI**: 70+ = overbought, 30- = oversold
- **MACD**: Positive = bullish momentum, negative = bearish
- **ATR**: Volatility level (affects stop loss size)
- **Market Regime**: Current trend classification
- **Timeframe Alignment**: Are 5/15/60 min all agreeing?

### Step 5: Track Outcomes (CRITICAL!)

After the predicted timeframe (e.g., 30 minutes):

1. Go to "Track Outcome" tab
2. Enter what actually happened:
   - Actual direction (up/down/sideways)
   - High/low reached
   - Points moved
3. Submit

**Why this matters:** System learns from outcomes and improves over time. After 100+ tracked predictions, accuracy significantly increases!

### Step 6: Review Pattern Performance

Check "Pattern Performance Metrics" to see:
- **Overall win rate** across all predictions
- **Best performing patterns** (>70% accuracy)
- **Worst performing patterns** (<50% - avoid these!)
- **Best days/sessions** for each pattern

**Use this data to:**
- Only trade high-performing patterns
- Avoid patterns that don't work
- Trade during optimal days/sessions

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Quality Over Quantity
**Don't trade every prediction!** Only trade when:
- Confidence ≥ 75%
- Quality badge = HIGH
- 4/4 or 3/4 methods agree
- Timeframes aligned

You might only get 2-3 high-quality setups per day. That's fine!

### 2. Always Track Outcomes
This is **THE MOST IMPORTANT** step. Without outcome tracking:
- System can't learn
- Pattern performance stays unknown
- Accuracy doesn't improve

Set a reminder to track outcomes 30 minutes after each prediction.

### 3. Start Small
When testing the system:
- Use small position sizes
- Trade during low-volatility hours first
- Build confidence before scaling

### 4. Review Weekly
Every Sunday, review:
- Overall win rate
- Best performing patterns
- Worst performing patterns
- Best days/sessions
- Adjust strategy accordingly

### 5. Respect WAIT Signals
If system says **WAIT**, it's protecting you from:
- Low confidence setups
- Conflicting signals
- Insufficient data
- Uncertain market conditions

Patience is profitable!

## 🔧 Understanding the 4 Methods

### Method 1: Pattern Matching
**What it does:** Finds similar historical charts and checks what happened next

**Strength:** Pattern recognition, historical precedent
**Weakness:** Requires large dataset

### Method 2: Temporal Analysis  
**What it does:** Identifies day-of-week and session patterns

**Strength:** Captures recurring calendar effects
**Weakness:** Needs 10+ examples per condition

### Method 3: Technical Indicators
**What it does:** Uses RSI, MACD, ATR for quantitative analysis

**Strength:** Mathematical, objective
**Weakness:** Can lag price action

### Method 4: AI Vision
**What it does:** AI analyzes chart visually like a trader would

**Strength:** Flexible, sees complex patterns
**Weakness:** Can be subjective

**When 3+ agree:** Very high confidence!

   - ⚠️ 60min not aligned (proceed with caution)

5. **Action**
   - Enter long at 16,000
   - Stop at 15,980 (20 points)
   - Target at 16,050 (50 points)
   - Risk/Reward: 1:2.5 ✓

6. **30 Minutes Later**

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "No similar patterns found"
**Fix:** Upload more charts. Need 50+ minimum, 500+ ideal.

### "All predictions show WAIT"
**Fix:** This is good! System is filtering low-quality setups. Be patient.

### "Pattern performance shows no data"
**Fix:** Track at least 10 outcomes first. Takes time to build stats.

### "Low confidence scores"
**Fix:** Normal with small dataset. Upload more charts and track outcomes.
